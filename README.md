VIM-MARK-STANDALONE   
===============================================================================
This repo is forked from https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-mark

The difference is that this repo is the **standalone version**.
This one does NOT depend on any other library or plugin.
All you need is vim itself, nothing more!

(PS: The original one depends on a gigantic library which slows down vim, but barely uses any function of that library.)
